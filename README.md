# SpookyCss

SpookyCss is a responsive boilerplate based on the (un)official Sass version of Skeleton Framework.

-----

Spooky is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project. In a nutshell, it's Skeleton with some adjustments of personal taste and a tentative of being bootstrap compatible.
